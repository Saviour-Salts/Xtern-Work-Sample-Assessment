    "Firstly, I realized that the address for one of the coworking spaces was not provided and so I had to get the right address using Google Map and also made sure that all the addresses provided were accurate. After I got all the addresses for the coworking spaces, I took into consideration the distance from the housing facility to each coworking space and the esential amenities available at each coworking space. Initially, I took into account the cost of using/renting each coworking space. However, due to unavailability in how some of these coworking spaces rented out their place, it did not become necessary to include it in my data.\n",
    "I then used factors such as distance from the housing facility to each coworking space and the number of essential services provided by each coworking space and the availability of a conference room to host a Ted Talk, to select the most convenient coworking space. The selection process was such that I placed a threshold on the distance between the cowroking space and the hosuing facility, I chose 8 miles as the threshold because that seemed like a 'normal' distance distance to travel to get to work from home. I was also interested in those coworking spaces that had at least 8 out of the 11 essential amenities provided by an 'average' coworking space. After considering these factors, I wrote a code in python to select the most convenient coworking space. The results from the analysis showed that \"Industrious Mass Ave\" is the most convenient coworking space. Because the results from the analysis gave us just one coworking space, there was no need to further analyze the data since all we needed was just one coworking space. However, if the result of the analysis listed more than one coworking space, then we would need more factors to continue the analysis until the most convenient coworking space is selected. In that case, we would want to go into details about the cost of renting each coworking space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, with the help of Google Map, I randomly selected 18 restaurants (these restaurants were selected so that the probability of having the same meal every week is very minimal) near the housing facility. The reason for this is that it was assumed that Xterns would go to for their weekly dinner from home and not go from the selected coworking space. I gathered the names of the restaurants, their respective distances from the housing unit, the amount that could be spent on food per person and their opening hours on Saturdays and presented the data as a dataframe using the pandas library in python. I was only interested in their Saturday working hours because it was assumed that Xterns would have their weekly dinner on Saturdays. Again, using factors such as distance from the housing facility to the restaurants, cost of food in the restaurants per person, I was able to reduce the number of restaurants from 18 to 6. However, because we needed 10 different restaurants for the 10-week plan, I slightly increased the threshold placed on the distance and cost and finally, I was able to get exactly 10 different restaurants upon the adjustment of the thresholds. For this, the threshold placed was such that the distance is in a radius of 8 miles from the housing facility and the cost of food per person is USD12 and below or the disance is in a radius of 6 miles from the housing facility and the cost of food per person is between USD12 and USD24.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10-week period I proposed for this sample is October 18, 2021 to December 27, 2021. Using EventBrite, I was able to put together some exciting sporting, gaming, music and art events that would be happening in the aforementioned time frame in Indianapolis. I refined my search using factors such as cost of attendance per person, date and time for event and distance from both the housing facility and the selected coworking space. The reason I considered both distances was because for some of the events, Xterns would have to go from the coworking space whlies for the rest, they would have to go from the housing facility to the event location. I then presented a sample 10-week activities plan which includes a weekly dinner in the earlier selected restaurants, a biweekly sport, gaming, music and art event, and one Ted Talk event. The summary of the results was presented also adds the event date and time, event location and distances from the hosuing facility and the selected coworking space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is important to mention that I presented my findings in each step using a dataframe since my data was not large and it could easily be read. Notwithstanding, one may choose to use data visualization to understand the results but I did not use that because my data, its analysis and results was relatively easier to understand even withouth using data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I was was able to to use available resources and the initial set of data given to me to select the most convenient coworking space, and also present a sample 10-week activities plan which includes a weekly dinner at different restaurants, a biweekly sport, gaming, music and art event, and one Ted Talk event as required."
